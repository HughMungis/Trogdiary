# lernin some git!

Hello, I crave chaos and blueberry eggos. :)

Some more words. Dear Trogdor, today I learned how to use git and how to make a new repo.

Dear Trogdor, today I met a wonderful Goat. I think he is powerful and majestic, and we should add him as a member of our world-domination team.

Dearest Lord Burninator, I fear that the Goat may be too powerful. I learned that he also brews potions, and upon asking if I could purchase some, I learned that his potions are far too powerful for me. I did not push him on this issue, but perhaps he will see and understand your power. I will see if I may enclose a sample with my next letter.

My Burning Lord, the Majestic Goat has agreed to send you a sample of his strongest potions. They shall be delivered to you upon the morrow.
