# lernin some git!

Today I noticed a very bad thing in Wuhan.  Hopefully it is nothing

Hello, I crave chaos and blueberry eggos. :)

## 2020-12-15

Some more words. Dear Trogdor, today I learned how to use git and how to make a new repo.

## 2020-12-16

Dear Trogdor, today I met a wonderful Goat. I think he is powerful and majestic, and we should add him as a member of our world-domination team.

## 2020-12-17

Dearest Lord Burninator, I fear that the Goat may be too powerful. I learned that he also brews potions, and upon asking if I could purchase some, I learned that his potions are far too powerful for me. I did not push him on this issue, but perhaps he will see and understand your power. I will see if I may enclose a sample with my next letter.S

## 2020-12-18

My Burning Lord, the Servile Goat has agreed to send you a sample of his strongest potions. They shall be delivered to you upon the morrow \[sic] amazon estimates your package will arrive in 1 week.

My Dearest Flame upon the Peasants of our land, you would hardly believe how joyous I was to see your flame growing ever stronger in the distance as you consumed the Majestic Goat's Strongest Postions. The whole sky lit up with your firey breath - and it brought a tear to my eye.

I have inventied an incredible device for time travel and used it to obtain a taco that is about -1 month old.  It is the freshest taco I have ever consumed.

## 2021-04-20

Lord Burninator, today I ate a sandwich.

Museums took the grass from the my yard in my pocket and declared it modern art

Committing my password into a git repository in my previous journal entry was a mistake

## 2021-02-19
The internet was a mistake

## 2021-02-20
But it was a big, beautiful mistake in the style of go big or go home.

## 2021-02-21
Upon realizing how big a  mistake the Internets were, the Cats got in and decided to have their way with it. So now there are Cats on the Internets. The Internets are now less of a terrible place than before.

## 2021-02-22
OHHH SHIIIT DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE GOATS ON THE INTERNETS TOO? HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS BEFORE?!?

Also, GHOSTS! GHOSTS! The unholy see through glove of the underworld is back! They stole the damn pizza again!

## 2021-02-23
Why are we here? Just to suffer? Each night I can feel my legs but not my arms since I traded them for soup.

## 2021-02-23
We are building the tower to God out of legos and now we may never fall but we have gotten the pieces stuck again. Someone forgot the brick puller...Steve.

I did some analytics work to try and figure out how many Goats vs. the number of Ghosts on the internet. And you know what? I was glad to discover these numbers. Here are the results:

| Type   | Count  |
| ------ | -----: |
| Goats  | 999972 |
| Ghosts | 50386  |
| Cats   | 73505  |

I wrote a song.
```
The internet is really really great - for Goats!
I have a fast connection so I don't have to wait - for Goats!
I research browse and shop - for Goats!
Until I've had enough and I have to stop - for Goats!
The internet is for Goats~
The internet is for Goats~
Just fill your Moats and drive your Boats for Goats, Goats Goats!
```

We have lost the cats of the world at basketball, this is our score now. Hopefully the goats will bring back up soon.

| Team     | Score  |
| ---------| -----: |
| Cats     | 420    |
| Hoomans  | -69    |
| Goats    | 4096   |
| Ghosts   | 7      |

We doomed the world and the cake was a lie. But at least we have Tacos. So there's that.

## 2021-03-06
Blue up the moon with green paint...delicious.

## 2021-03-06
Someone added goat images to our library again! They were nice. But also, kinda scary but cool.

## 2021-03-07
Working with multiple remotes allows you to have your git history backed up to multiple places!
